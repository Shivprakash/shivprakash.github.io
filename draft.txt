Based on the LinkedIn profile and CV you’ve provided, you have an impressive background with extensive experience at Walmart Global Tech, a strong technical skill set, leadership capabilities, and a proven track record of delivering high-impact, scalable solutions. This positions you well for senior individual contributor (IC) roles like Senior Architect, Principal Engineer, or Senior Engineering Manager at FAANG (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and top startups. However, to maximize your chances of landing these highly competitive roles, there are opportunities to refine and strengthen both your LinkedIn profile and CV. Below is a detailed review with actionable suggestions:

Strengths of Your LinkedIn Profile and CV
Deep Technical Expertise: Your experience spans backend development, data engineering, MLOps, cloud architecture, and big data—key areas of interest for FAANG and top startups. Your technical skills (e.g., Kafka, Spark, Kubernetes, GCP, Azure) align well with modern tech stacks.
Leadership Experience: You’ve led high-performance teams, managed cross-geo collaboration, and driven multi-million-dollar initiatives, showcasing both technical and managerial chops suitable for Senior Engineering Manager or Principal Engineer roles.
Business Impact: Quantifiable achievements (e.g., $590M savings, 40% cost reduction, 500% throughput increase) demonstrate your ability to deliver value, which is critical for senior roles.
Retail Domain Expertise: Your work in supply chain, inventory management, and demand forecasting at Walmart is a strong differentiator, especially for companies like Amazon or retail-focused startups.
Patents and Innovation: Your patents and contributions to Walmart’s critical systems signal creativity and problem-solving—highly valued at FAANG companies.
Education: Pursuing an MS in Machine Learning from Georgia Tech adds credibility and aligns with AI-driven roles at top-tier companies.
Areas for Improvement
While your foundation is solid, FAANG and top startups often look for concise, polished, and highly targeted profiles/CVs that emphasize strategic thinking, cutting-edge innovation, and alignment with their specific needs (e.g., distributed systems at Google, AWS expertise at Amazon, or ML at Netflix). Here’s how you can optimize:

1. LinkedIn Profile Refinements
Headline

Current: "Engineering Leader | Data & AI | Driving Innovation & Business Value | Walmart"
Suggestion: Make it more specific and impactful. Highlight your target role and key strengths.
Example: "Senior Engineering Leader | Data, AI & Cloud Architect | $500M+ Business Impact | Ex-Walmart"
Why: FAANG recruiters often skim headlines. Adding a role target (e.g., "Senior Engineering Leader") and a standout metric grabs attention.
Summary

Current: It’s detailed but lengthy and slightly scattered, mixing personal passions with professional goals.
Suggestion: Tighten it up to 3-4 concise paragraphs with a clear narrative:
Who you are (e.g., "Engineering Leader with 12+ years scaling systems at Walmart").
What you’ve achieved (e.g., "Delivered $590M in savings via inventory optimization").
What you bring (e.g., "Expertise in data platforms, MLOps, and cloud architecture").
What you’re seeking (e.g., "Looking to architect innovative solutions at a FAANG-tier company").
Remove the "To Connect" line and "Open for mentoring startups" from the summary—shift these to a pinned post or "Featured" section to keep the focus professional.
Experience Section

Current: Detailed but overly verbose with some repetition (e.g., inventory placement mentioned multiple times).
Suggestion: Streamline each role to 3-5 bullet points max, focusing on outcomes over tasks. Use action verbs and metrics:
Example (Senior Software Engineering Manager):
"Led a CTO-priority inventory placement solution, saving $590M and scaling demand forecasting for 10K+ nodes."
"Reduced cloud operating costs by 31% through re-architecture and optimization."
"Drove engineering excellence, cutting incident rates by 20% across 9 direct reports."
Avoid jargon like “horizontal of additional 15 folks”—use “oversaw a team of 24 engineers” instead.
Add a "Featured" section with links to patents, publications, or impactful projects to showcase thought leadership.
Skills

Current: Lists "Neural Networks," "Cross-team Collaboration," "Complex Systems"—good but generic.
Suggestion: Add 5-10 more specific, high-demand skills (e.g., "Distributed Systems," "AWS," "TensorFlow," "Terraform," "GraphQL") to match FAANG job descriptions. Pin the most relevant ones to the top.
Contact Info

Current: Includes phone number and email directly.
Suggestion: Remove the phone number from public view (use LinkedIn messaging instead) to maintain privacy and professionalism.
2. CV Refinements
Length and Formatting

Current: 6 pages (LinkedIn) and 3 pages (CV OCR)—too long for senior roles.
Suggestion: Condense to 2 pages max for the CV. FAANG recruiters spend ~6 seconds scanning initially—focus on recency and impact.
Use a clean, modern template (e.g., two-column layout for skills/tools and single-column for experience).
Drop early internships (e.g., Indian Railways, HCL) or summarize pre-2012 roles in a single line under “Early Career.”
Professional Summary

Current: Detailed but wordy and repetitive across documents.
Suggestion: Shorten to 3-4 lines:
Example: "Engineering Leader with 12+ years at Walmart, delivering $590M in savings via scalable data and cloud solutions. Expert in architecture, MLOps, and cross-geo team leadership, targeting Senior Architect/Principal Engineer roles."
Tailor this slightly for each application (e.g., emphasize AWS for Amazon, ML for Google).
Experience Section

Current: Heavy on technical details and jargon, light on strategic framing.
Suggestion: For each role, use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) in concise bullets:
Example (Senior Software Engineering Manager):
"Architected an inventory placement system, enabling $590M in savings by optimizing demand forecasting across 10K+ nodes."
"Slashed operating costs by 31% via cloud migration and compression for a replenishment platform."
"Led 9 engineers and 15 cross-functional members, boosting productivity 25% through agile refinements."
Cut redundant details (e.g., “Driving roadmap with cross group apply collaboration”—simplify to “Collaborated cross-functionally on roadmaps”).
For older roles (e.g., SDE II), use 1-2 bullets max.
Technical Skills

Current: Extensive but cluttered and incomplete in some areas.
Suggestion: Group into categories for readability:
Languages: Java, Python, Scala (inferring from tools—add these explicitly if true).
Data: Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Cassandra, Elasticsearch.
Cloud: GCP, Azure, OpenStack, Kubernetes, Docker.
MLOps: CI/CD, Airflow, Model Versioning.
Add FAANG-relevant tools (e.g., AWS, TensorFlow, Prometheus) if you’ve used them or can upskill quickly.
Education

Current: Lists all schools, including secondary.
Suggestion: Keep only Georgia Tech MS and YCCE BE. Add expected graduation for MS (e.g., “Expected 2026”).
Patents and Publications

Current: Mentioned but lack detail in CV.
Suggestion: List titles and brief outcomes:
“Database System for Fulfillment Capacity Tracking – Enabled real-time inventory for 22M items.”
Move to a separate “Innovations” section for emphasis.
Certifications

Current: Relevant but buried.
Suggestion: Highlight 1-2 key ones (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Sterling SMCFS) under a “Certifications” header; drop less impactful ones (e.g., DB2 Associate).
3. Tailoring for FAANG and Startups
Amazon: Emphasize AWS, distributed systems, and supply chain wins (e.g., inventory placement). Highlight leadership principles like “Ownership” and “Dive Deep.”
Google: Focus on scalability (e.g., 500k TPS comms platform), ML (e.g., demand forecasting), and patents. Mention GCP experience prominently.
Apple: Highlight privacy/compliance (e.g., SOX, CCPA) and zero-defect delivery.
Netflix: Stress streaming expertise (e.g., Kafka, Spark Streaming) and high-throughput systems.
Facebook/Meta: Play up AI/ML (e.g., chatbot enhancements) and cross-functional collaboration.
Startups: Emphasize greenfield projects, rapid scaling, and mentorship experience.
Overall Assessment
Your LinkedIn profile and CV are good enough to get noticed by FAANG and top startups, given your experience and impact. However, they’re not yet optimized for the ultra-competitive senior IC/manager hiring process. With the refinements above—streamlining content, sharpening focus, and tailoring to specific companies—you’ll significantly boost your chances of landing interviews.
